			<h2>Background</h2>
			I took my first breath on the 15th of april 1994 only weighing at 4 pounds! I never knew my true potential in life before the age of 12. After I created my first Piczo website, that’s when everything unfolded. My skills and love for designing website grew so fast I always wanted to learn more and do more. At the age of 15 I had my very own sub-domain which I had more fun re-designing the template from scratch then actually blogging. After playing with codes I wanted to expand my knowledge with Corel Paint Shop Pro and then went to Adobe Photoshop. I knew from then what I wanted to do. Become a Graphic Designer.

			<h2>Strengths</h2>
			I started my Graphic Design course in 2012, straight out of high-school. Before college I was a photoshop lover, it was my go-to program with what ever the project may be. After I started college they got us into InDesign and Illustrator, and now I find my self in Illustrator all the time. I absolutely love designing magazines, posters, business cards anything that can be printed. Although my first love was Web Design, that will always stay with me and it will always be my passion regardless of where I’m going.
